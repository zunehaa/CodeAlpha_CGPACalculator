# CodeAlpha_CGPACalculator

This was my first internship project, where I developed a simple and efficient **CGPA Calculator** using **C++**. The tool allows students to input their grades and credit hours to automatically calculate their **CGPA**.

## 📘 CGPA Calculator (C++ Project)

A simple and interactive **C++ console application** that calculates your **Semester GPA (SGPA)** and **Cumulative GPA (CGPA)** based on course grades and credit hours. This project was created as part of a virtual internship task and demonstrates good use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in C++.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Input any number of courses
- Grade validation (A, B, C, D, F only)
- Credit hour validation (0.5 – 5.0)
- Calculates SGPA for the current semester
- Updates CGPA based on previous results
- Clean and formatted output display
- Option to repeat calculation for another semester

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:** OOP, Input Validation, Exception Handling, Templates  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `<iostream>`  
  - `<vector>`  
  - `<iomanip>`  
  - `<map>`  
  - `<limits>`  
  - `<algorithm>`  
  - `<sstream>`  
  - `<stdexcept>`  
  - `<cctype>`

## ✨ Future Improvements

- File saving & loading for course history  
- GUI interface using Qt or Python (C++ backend)  
- GPA prediction tool (e.g., required grades to reach 3.5+)  
- Mobile version using Flutter with C++ logic

## 💡 Internship Task Info

This project was created as **Task #1** for my virtual internship with **CodeAlpha**, where I selected and completed the CGPA Calculator to demonstrate my programming skills using clean code structure, input handling, and OOP principles.
