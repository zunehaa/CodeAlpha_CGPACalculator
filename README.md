# CodeAlpha_CGPACalculator

This was my first internship project, where I developed a simple and efficient **CGPA Calculator** using **C++**. The tool allows students to input their grades and credit hours to automatically calculate their **CGPA**.

## 📘 CGPA Calculator (C++ Project)

A simple and interactive **C++ console application** that calculates your **Semester GPA (SGPA)** and **Cumulative GPA (CGPA)** based on course grades and credit hours. This project was created as part of a virtual internship task and demonstrates good use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in C++.
